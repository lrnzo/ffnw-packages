define Package/libwlocate/description
	libwlocate is a shared library that can be used for location-based services.
	It checks for WLAN-networks that are available near to a user and retrieves the
	current geographic position out of them.
	Thus no GPS is needed for positioning. This WLAN-based geolocation happens
	without using any of the commercial services that do the same but track the users
	position and data. libwlocate instead bases on the free OpenWLANMap project.
